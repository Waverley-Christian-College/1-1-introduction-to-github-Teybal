 <p>Github is like a big awesome cool folder for online project. Every since i was i kid ive been the 
 git and i kept track of every change i made so i dont lose work. repositories store project files and history. I got 90 on my history.
 theres clones of local copies spooky lol xd. committing saves changes and pushing uploads them to github.
 markdowns do the styled text
